# NEWS ANOMALY DETECTION SYSTEM - DUAL PHASE ARCHITECTURE

## System Overview

The News Anomaly Detection System operates in two distinct phases to identify fake news, market manipulation, and fraudulent patterns in financial markets. This dual-phase approach separates content analysis from pattern validation to achieve higher accuracy and reduce false positives.

---

## PHASE 1: NODE 9A - Content Analysis & Feature Extraction

### Purpose
Extract quantifiable signals from news articles and social media content WITHOUT making filtering decisions. This node acts as a feature engineering layer that produces numerical scores and metadata.

### Core Functions

#### 1. Textual Feature Extraction
- **Sensationalism Scoring**: Detect clickbait language, excessive punctuation (!!! or ???), ALL CAPS usage, emotional language intensity
- **Urgency Scoring**: Identify time-pressure phrases ("BREAKING", "URGENT", "ACT NOW", "LIMITED TIME")
- **Unverified Claims Detection**: Flag hedging language ("allegedly", "rumored", "sources say", "unconfirmed reports")
- **Complexity Analysis**: Measure technical jargon density, readability metrics, sentence structure complexity

#### 2. Source Credibility Assessment
- **Domain Authority**: Evaluate source reliability (Bloomberg/Reuters = high, unknown blogs = low)
- **Publication History**: Check if source has established track record
- **Author Attribution**: Verify if content has named authors vs. anonymous posts

#### 3. Entity & Keyword Recognition
- **Financial Terms**: Extract mentions of "fraud", "investigation", "SEC", "lawsuit", "bankruptcy", "merger"
- **Named Entities**: Identify companies, executives, regulators, financial institutions
- **Temporal Markers**: Classify as past event, current situation, or future prediction

#### 4. Contextual Tagging
- **Topic Classification**: Categorize content (earnings report, fraud allegation, merger announcement, regulatory action)
- **Sentiment Extraction**: Determine overall tone (positive, negative, neutral) and intensity
- **Geographic Markers**: Identify relevant jurisdictions and markets

### Output Structure
NODE 9A produces a structured data object for each piece of content:
```
Content Scores (0-1 scale):
├─ Sensationalism Score: 0.85
├─ Urgency Score: 0.90
├─ Unverified Claims Score: 0.75
├─ Source Credibility Score: 0.15
├─ Complexity Score: 0.40
└─ Composite Anomaly Score: 0.78

Metadata Tags:
├─ Keywords: ["BREAKING", "EXPOSED", "ACT NOW"]
├─ Entities: ["XYZ Corp", "CEO John Doe"]
├─ Topic: "fraud_allegation"
├─ Sentiment: "negative" (intensity: 0.88)
└─ Temporal: "current_event"
```

### Critical Principle
**NODE 9A DOES NOT FILTER**. It only scores and tags. A legitimate Bloomberg article about an SEC investigation will trigger keywords like "fraud" and "investigation", but will have:
- Low sensationalism score (factual reporting style)
- High source credibility score (Bloomberg domain)
- Low unverified claims score (official sources cited)

These scores are passed to NODE 9B for final decision-making.

---

## PHASE 2: NODE 9B - Cross-Validation & Fraud Pattern Detection

### Purpose
Validate NODE 9A findings against historical market data and detect sophisticated fraud patterns that only emerge when combining news analysis with price/volume behavior over time.

### Core Functions

#### 1. News Validation Through Market Cross-Reference
NODE 9B receives NODE 9A scores and validates them against outputs from historical analysis nodes:

**Validation Process:**
- **Price Correlation Check** (uses NODE 1 - Historical Price Analysis): Does the news align with actual price movement?
- **Volume Validation** (uses NODE 2 - Volume Analysis): Is there unusual trading volume supporting the news?
- **Volatility Assessment** (uses NODE 3 - Volatility Analysis): Does volatility match the news severity?
- **Sentiment Cross-Check** (uses NODE 5 - Historical Sentiment): Is this sentiment shift abnormal for this stock?
- **Sector Correlation** (uses NODE 7 - Correlation Analysis): Are related stocks moving similarly?
- **Macro Context** (uses NODE 6 - Macro Indicators): Do broader market conditions support this movement?

**Decision Logic Examples:**

✅ **Legitimate News Confirmed:**
```
Bloomberg reports: "SEC launches fraud investigation into XYZ Corp"
├─ NODE 9A: Keywords detected but low sensationalism, high source credibility
├─ NODE 1: Price dropped -12% (expected reaction)
├─ NODE 2: Volume spike 400% (significant interest)
├─ NODE 7: Sector peers unaffected (company-specific issue)
└─ DECISION: LEGITIMATE NEWS - No action needed
```

❌ **Fake News Detected:**
```
Unknown blog posts: "BREAKING: XYZ Corp MIRACLE CURE - Stock to 10X!"
├─ NODE 9A: High sensationalism, low source credibility, high urgency
├─ NODE 1: No significant price movement
├─ NODE 2: Normal trading volume
├─ Reputable sources: No corroboration
└─ DECISION: LIKELY FAKE NEWS - Flag for investigation
```

#### 2. Pump & Dump Fraud Detection

**Pattern Recognition:**
```
Stage 1 - Pump Phase:
├─ Suspicious news appears (NODE 9A: high urgency, low credibility)
├─ Multiple coordinated social media posts (NODE 5: abnormal sentiment surge)
├─ Sharp price increase (NODE 1: returns exceed historical norms)
├─ Volume spike (NODE 2: 500%+ above average)
└─ Pattern detected: Potential pump phase

Stage 2 - Monitoring:
├─ Track price behavior over 24-72 hours
├─ Monitor for news retraction or disappearance
└─ Watch for coordinated selling

Stage 3 - Dump Confirmation:
├─ Sharp price drop (often -30% to -60%)
├─ Volume returns to normal
├─ Original news sources delete content or go silent
└─ CONFIRMED: Pump & Dump Scheme - Alert regulators
```

#### 3. Unexplained Price Anomaly Detection

**Identifies market manipulation when:**
```
Market Behavior:
├─ NODE 1: Price movement outside 3-sigma historical bands
├─ NODE 3: Volatility spike without fundamental catalyst
├─ NODE 4: Unusual intraday trading patterns (spoofing, layering)

News Environment:
├─ NODE 9A: No credible news to justify movement
├─ Reputable sources: Silent on the stock
├─ NODE 7: Sector peers show normal behavior

Context Check:
├─ NODE 6: No macro event explanation
├─ Earnings calendar: No upcoming catalysts

CONCLUSION: Unexplained price anomaly - Possible manipulation
```

#### 4. News-Price Divergence Analysis

**Detects scenarios where news and price action contradict:**

**Type A - Positive News, Negative Price:**
```
Major positive announcement (credible source)
+ Price decreases significantly
= Possible explanations:
  ├─ Already priced in
  ├─ Hidden negative information (insider knowledge)
  ├─ Market skepticism about sustainability
  └─ Investigate further
```

**Type B - Negative News, Positive Price:**
```
Major negative announcement (credible source)
+ Price increases
= Possible explanations:
  ├─ Market expected worse news
  ├─ Contrarian buying opportunity recognized
  ├─ Short covering activity
  └─ Monitor for reversal
```

**Type C - Fake News, Real Price Impact (Manipulation):**
```
Low-credibility sensational news
+ Significant price movement
+ No corroboration from reputable sources
= HIGH PROBABILITY MANIPULATION:
  └─ Coordinated scheme to move market
```

### Output Structure
NODE 9B produces actionable intelligence:
```
Validation Results:
├─ News Classification: [LEGITIMATE | FAKE | UNCERTAIN]
├─ Confidence Score: 0.92
└─ Supporting Evidence: [list of corroborating signals]

Fraud Pattern Alerts:
├─ Pump & Dump: DETECTED (Stage: dump_confirmed)
├─ Price Manipulation: SUSPECTED (confidence: 0.78)
└─ News-Price Divergence: DETECTED (type: positive_news_negative_price)

Anomaly Assessment:
├─ Severity Score: 0.85 (HIGH)
├─ Risk Level: CRITICAL
└─ Recommended Action: FLAG_FOR_REGULATORY_REVIEW

Context Summary:
├─ Historical Precedent: 3 similar patterns detected in past 12 months
├─ Sector Impact: Isolated (no contagion detected)
└─ Market Conditions: Normal volatility environment
```

```

### Why This Two-Phase Approach?

**Separation of Concerns:**
- NODE 9A focuses solely on content analysis without market context
- NODE 9B brings in temporal and cross-asset context for validation

**Reduces False Positives:**
- Keywords alone would flag legitimate Bloomberg fraud investigations as fake news
- Market validation confirms whether news is genuine or manipulative

**Enables Sophisticated Fraud Detection:**
- Pump & dump schemes only visible when combining news timing with price/volume patterns over days
- Price manipulation requires cross-referencing multiple data sources

**Scalability:**
- NODE 9A can process thousands of articles in parallel
- NODE 9B performs deeper, computationally expensive analysis only on flagged content
